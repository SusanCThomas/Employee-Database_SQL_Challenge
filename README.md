# SQL Homework - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

## Employee-Database_SQL_Challenge

### Background:

Within this challenge, Pewlett Hackard presented a challenge to complete a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

Tables were designed to hold data in the CSVs, the CSVs were imported into a SQL database, and the data was queried. The following were performed:

1. Data Engineering

2. Data Analysis

### [Data Modeling](https://github.com/SusanCThomas/Employee-Database_SQL_Challenge/tree/main/Data_Modeling)

Inspected the CSVs and sketched out an [ERD](https://github.com/SusanCThomas/Employee-Database_SQL_Challenge/blob/main/Data_Modeling/QuickDBD-ERD.png) of the tables using [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com).
